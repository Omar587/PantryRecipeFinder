                 "I always thought these were basically the same thing but apparently they're quite different. Sautéing is medium-high heat with occasional tossing, stir frying is very high heat with constant movement. The pan and fat also differ. Did you know this distinction before learning to cook properly?"),

                 "I know you're supposed to rest steak before cutting but I've seen everything from 2 minutes to 15 minutes. I did an experiment and honestly resting for 5 minutes on a warm plate made a visible difference in how much juice stayed in the meat. What do you do?"),

The long boil is what makes it creamy and white. Season with tare (soy, mirin, sake). Worth every minute."),
